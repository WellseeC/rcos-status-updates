## Last Week's Accomplishments

Asher(team leader) says he has an idea to let Ninja issue reform in his larger build system rework, so he took it from me. Glad that I was just beginning, and I was assigned to a new issue, which is to replace includes with forward declarations.

## This Week's Plan

Go through every header files and replace includes with forward declarations. Try to get it down.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing for now.
