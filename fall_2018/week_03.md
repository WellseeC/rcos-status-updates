## Last Week's Accomplishments

I figure out I need to create a new file for supporting running the editted code for vertex pipeline.

## This Week's Plan

Still work on vertex stuff and do more research about it.

## Anything Blocking?

Yeah, I spent a lot of time on editting the old code for supporting running, but told by mentor a new file is necessary.
