## Last Week's Accomplishments

I finished the issue that replace includes with forward declarations. The purpose of this issue is to reducing compilation time. The compilation time was about 2 minutes at the beginning of this semester, and it's about 10 seconds right now. Additionally, what I've done is a rework of another team member, so there's not much to correct, but viewing tons of files with unfamiliar coding was really painful. So.........................Give me an A pls.

## This Week's Plan

Waiting...

## Anything Blocking?

Actually, my first issue is blocked till now. I spent the first month of this semester on vertex shader building with Dhruv(He's responsible for vertex buffer), but we met difficulties on linking the new vertex class to the rest of the files. Because the issue is not complete and may have errors, I didn't commit it to the upstream. And after that, I was assigned to new issues.
