## Last Week's Accomplishments

Not too much, it's been exam week and I got stuck in building up pipeline stuffs.

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to finish the first part of building vertex shader and start the second part, building vertex buffer.

## Anything Blocking?

Yeah, it's buggy in building pipelines.
