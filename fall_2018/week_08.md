## Last Week's Accomplishments

Continuing the issue, go through every header files and change includes into forward declarations. But there are severl tests around, I didn't do much. So the difference between last week and this week is I am having a new big assignment due this week(about 50% the grade of the term for Game Story Telling).

## This Week's Plan

Just keep doing it, a lot of files.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing for now.
