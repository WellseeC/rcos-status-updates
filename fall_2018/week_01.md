## Last Week's Accomplishments

I finished setting up Soul Engine on my laptop and started the first part of my first issue, building vertex shader. And I'm half way through that.

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to finish the first part of building vertex shader and start the second part, building vertex buffer.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm new to graphics, although I like it a lot, there's a lot of thing to learn.
